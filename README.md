# Mental-Health-Conversation
The prevalence of mental health disorders has gone up recently. In this research, deep learning techniques are being used to create a conversational chatbot for the patients. In this case, data with tags, patterns, and responses are being loaded as input. The output that is produced utilising these inputs will depend on the mental health condition of the patient. Some of the most popular Python libraries, such as JSON and the Natural Language Toolkit, are being used here. We are using a method known as neural networks, which trains computers to interpret information in a manner similar to that of the human brain. This project's outcome (mental health condition) has been accurately predicted.


The current paradigm centres on the creation of a specialised app intended for patient-centered interactions about mental health. This particular application functions as a comprehensive platform that facilitates smooth communication and provides essential assistance. Serving as a central location, it hopes to improve user experience and guarantee increased accessibility, especially for those who are actively looking for help and support for their mental health.



Our goal with the suggested paradigm is to maximise the benefits of mental health talks by directly incorporating exact inputs, response guidelines, and patterns into the design of the programme. An independent application is no longer required thanks to this integration. Rather, the chatbot functions independently, producing responses through an algorithmic process based on patient input and pre-established standards. This methodology not only amplifies accessibility but also yields notable improvements in the efficacy of mental health support services, guaranteeing prompt and customised aid to those in need of mental health support.
